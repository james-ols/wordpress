Modified version of original SendGrid connector.

## Description

Forked by Orangeleaf Systems to remove functionality and potential vulnerabilities

## Installation

Requirements:

1. PHP version >= 7.2 
2. To send emails through SMTP you need to install also the 'Swift Mailer' plugin.
3. If wp_mail() function has been declared by another plugin that you have installed, you won't be able to use the SendGrid plugin

### Global settings

SendGrid settings can optionally be defined as global variables (wp-config.php):

1. Set the API key. You need to make sure you set the Mail Send permissions to FULL ACCESS, Stats to READ ACCESS and Template Engine to READ or FULL ACCESS when you created the api key on SendGrid side, so you can send emails and see statistics on wordpress):
    * API key:  define('SENDGRID_API_KEY', 'sendgrid_api_key');

2. Set email related settings:
    * Send method ('api' or 'smtp'): define('SENDGRID_SEND_METHOD', 'api');
    * From name: define('SENDGRID_FROM_NAME', 'Example Name');
    * From email: define('SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL', 'from_email@example.com');
    * Reply to email: define('SENDGRID_REPLY_TO', 'reply_to@example.com');
    * Categories: define('SENDGRID_CATEGORIES', 'category_1,category_2');
    * Template: define('SENDGRID_TEMPLATE', 'templateID');
    * Content-type: define('SENDGRID_CONTENT_TYPE', 'html');
    * Unsubscribe Group: define('SENDGRID_UNSUBSCRIBE_GROUP', 'unsubscribeGroupId');

3. Set widget related settings:
    * Marketing Campaigns API key: define('SENDGRID_MC_API_KEY', 'sendgrid_mc_api_key');
    * Use the same authentication as for sending emails ('true' or 'false'): define('SENDGRID_MC_OPT_USE_TRANSACTIONAL', 'false');
    * The contact list ID: define('SENDGRID_MC_LIST_ID', 'listID');
    * Display the first and last name fields ('true' or 'false'): define('SENDGRID_MC_OPT_INCL_FNAME_LNAME', 'true');
    * First and last name fields are required ('true' or 'false'): define('SENDGRID_MC_OPT_REQ_FNAME_LNAME', 'true');
    * Signup confirmation email subject: define('SENDGRID_MC_SIGNUP_EMAIL_SUBJECT', 'Confirm subscription');
    * Signup confirmation email content: define('SENDGRID_MC_SIGNUP_EMAIL_CONTENT', '&lt;a href="%confirmation_link%"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;');
    * Signup confirmation page ID: define('SENDGRID_MC_SIGNUP_CONFIRMATION_PAGE', 'page_id');

4. Other configuration options:
    * Set a custom timeout for API requests to SendGrid in seconds: define('SENDGRID_REQUEST_TIMEOUT', 10);


### Filters

Use HTML content type for a single email:

```
add_filter('wp_mail_content_type', 'set_html_content_type');

// Send the email 

remove_filter('wp_mail_content_type', 'set_html_content_type');
```

Change the email contents for all emails before they are sent:

```
function change_content( $message, $content_type ) {   
    if ( 'text/plain' == $content_type ) {
      $message = $message . ' will be sent as text ' ;
    } else {
      $message = $message . ' will be sent as text and HTML ';
    }

    return $message;
}

add_filter( 'sendgrid_override_template', 'change_content' );
```

Changing the text content of all emails before they are sent:

```
function change_sendgrid_text_email( $message ) {
    return $message . ' changed by way of text filter ';
}

add_filter( 'sendgrid_mail_text', 'change_sendgrid_text_email' );
```

Changing the HTML content of all emails before they are sent:

```
function change_sendgrid_html_email( $message ) {
    return $message . ' changed by way of html filter ';
}

add_filter( 'sendgrid_mail_html', 'change_sendgrid_html_email' );
```

Note that all HTML emails sent through our plugin also contain the HTML body in the text part and that content will pass through the "sendgrid_mail_text" filter as well.

## Frequently asked questions

### What permissions should my API keys have ?

For the API Key used for sending emails (the General tab):
 - Full Access to Mail Send.
 - Read Access to Stats.
 - Read Access to Supressions > Unsubscribe Groups.
 - Read Access to Template Engine.
For the API Key used for contact upload (the Subscription Widget tab):
 - Full Access to Marketing Campaigns.


### Can I disable the opt-in email?

No. SendGridâ€™s Email Policy requires all email addressing being sent to by SendGrid customers be confirmed opt-in addresses.

### Can I use this plugin with BuddyPress ?

Yes. Our plugin required special integration with BuddyPress and it's regularly tested to ensure it behaves as expected. If you have noticed issues caused by installing this plugin along with BuddyPress, you can add the following line to your wp-config.php to disable it :

`define('SENDGRID_DISABLE_BUDDYPRESS', '1');`

If you're trying to send plaintext emails using BuddyPress, keep in mind that by default the whitespace content of those emails is normalized.

That means that some newlines might be missing if you expect them to be there.

To disable this functionality, you need to add the following line in your wp-config.php file:

`define('SENDGRID_DISABLE_BP_NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE', '1');`
